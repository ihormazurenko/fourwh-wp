                              <p>KNOWING YOUR TRUCK’S CARRYING CAPACITY</p>

                                <p>Most automotive and truck manufacturers (Ford, Chevy/GMC, Dodge, Toyota, Nissan, etc.) will provide the consumer with ratings to help determine the capacities of your truck as it was manufactured. Some of the weight ratings are posted on the driver’s side door jam, on a label in the glove box, or in the owner’s manual, or other literature.
                                </p>
                                <p>Camper weights both dry and wet vary depending on what optional equipment you have installed on your new camper and by what model of camper you are purchasing. Similar FWC models can vary by hundreds of pounds, depending on if the camper is empty inside, or is fully loaded with options. Truck and camper package handling can be greatly improved by the addition of support equipment like air bags, additional leaf springs, special shocks absorbers, and heavier duty E rated truck tires.
                                </p>
                                <p>GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating):  The GVWR value set by the truck manufacturer as the loaded weight of a single vehicle.
                                </p>
                                <p>GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating):  The GAWR value set by the truck manufacturer as the load-carrying capacity of a single axle system. There is a separate (and different) GAWR for the front and rear axles.
                                </p>
                                <p>PAYLOAD (Payload Capacity):  Payload and maximum payload capacity are terms used to describe a vehicle’s GVWR minus the weight of the vehicle, and minus all other weight applied to the vehicle: driver, passengers, specialty equipment, tongue weight of any items being towed, loads, etc.
                                </p>
                                <p>While support equipment (air bags, additional leaf springs, upgraded shocks, heavy duty tires, etc.) does not increase the factory ratings of GVWR, GAWR and Payload, they do improve the handling and stability of the truck while driving and the ability of the truck to handle greater loads safely.
                                </p>
                                <p>To determine the approximate weight of a camper, add the base model camper weight, along with the weight of all optional equipment you ordered. Also add the weight of your water tank full (most campers have a 20 gallon water tank = approx. 166 lbs.) and 2 propane tanks full = 20 lbs.).
                                </p>
                                <p>Because Four Wheel Campers is unfamiliar with your specific truck and how you intend to use it, Four Wheel Campers makes no warranties or representation express or implied as to the performance or reliability of your truck with a Four Wheel Pop-up Camper. We will do our best to pair you up with the right truck & camper combination, but ultimately the customer will be responsible to make the final decision on what they are comfortable with, as well as knowing the specifics of their particular trucks capacities.</p>
